To deploy the nodeRED flow, you need to install the following libraries:
https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-dashboard (npm install node-red-dashboard)
https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-node-serialport (npm install node-red-node-serialport)

You also need to open any mqtt node, edit the 'IT SHIT' connection, and insert a valid username and password.
